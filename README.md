- I am a data scientist with a proven record of academic achievement. You can see my publications on [Google Scholar's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DoD54yUAAAAJ&hl=en).
- I have worked to make healthcare data more accessible and improve the care of patients.

In the repositories below you can have a glimpse into some work I have done:

- [gkoutos-group/postcode](https://github.com/gkoutos-group/postcode) is the kernel of multiple analysis:
In many scenarios you have established datasets stored in different silos. Be it a hospital, census report, or your data problem. Although the hospital wrappers are not described in this repository, it is possible to explore this framework using the UK Census data.

Integrator & postcode tools provide a mechanism to orchestrate the Extract-Transform-Load of multiple data sources into a single data frame for analysis. It is capable of handling big data in SQL or CSVs. It comes with a mapping procedure to include the indexes of different sources, reducing the number of I/O operations.

This tool is built on top of Python and Pandas.

- [gkoutos-group/covidtracker_surgery](https://github.com/gkoutos-group/covidtracker_surgery) is a Covid-19 tracker:
During the highest points of the pandemic it was noticed that patients were not going into surgery due to both risks of complications and of contracting the morbidity in the hospital quarters.

The tracker of lost surgery is a tool that estimates the number of people that didn't undergo a surgery. This tool is being used for policy changes.

This tool is built in R using the Shiny framework.

- [gkoutos-group/threshold_picker](https://github.com/gkoutos-group/threshold_picker) is a support tool for model decision:
A risk model has trade-offs depending on the point of action. It is crucial to understand the consequences of each decision point.

This tool is used to assess a model, and understand how it performs compared to another model. This tool was used in different research studies I participated at the University of Birmingham.

This tool is built in R using the Shiny framework.

- [labrax/minimal-slurm](https://github.com/labrax/minimal-slurm) is a simple setup for Slurm:
Slurm is a software widely used in research to submit, queue and execute jobs. It is used in many research institution with high performance computing.

This repository shows a implementation, without database, to have Slurm as a queueing system on a local machine. This was used in the hospital to enable the creation of multiple models in the research server.
